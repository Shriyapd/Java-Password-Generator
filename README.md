# Java-Password-Generator
The Java Password Generator Development Project aims to create a robust, secure, and user-friendly password generator application using the Java programming language. This application will help users generate strong passwords to enhance their online security and protect their accounts from unauthorized access.
# Implementation
## Password Generation Logic

- Character Sets:
  - Uppercase letters: A-Z
  - Lowercase letters: a-z
  - Digits: 0-9
  - Special characters: !@#$%^&*()-_=+[]{};:,.<>?/|\
- Algorithm:
  - Collect user preferences for character sets and password length.
  - Randomly select characters from the chosen sets until the password reaches the desired length.
  - Ensure at least one character from each selected set is included if specified.
